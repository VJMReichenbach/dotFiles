# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles for my linux setup. I use [toml-bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil) to manage my dotfiles.

## Installation

First you need to clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EldosHD/dotFiles.git ~/my_dotfiles
```

### Prequesits

You need a nerd font, rust and toml-bombadil installed.

The nerd font you can get from your package manager:

Arch: 
```bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm ttf-firacode-nerd curl
```

---

Rust you can get from [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And toml-bombadil you can get from cargo:

```bash
cargo install toml-bombadil
```

### Installing the dotfiles and dependencies

First I'd like to install a couple programs I find useful:

**Arch**. You'll need `yay` if your distro  doesn't ship with it:
```bash
yay -S --noconfirm visual-studio-code-bin
```

---

Then install all rust additional rust binaries:
```bash
cargo install exa du-dust bat
```

---

Lastly install the dotfiles:
```bash
bombadil install ~/my_dotfiles
bombadil link 
```

### Post Install
